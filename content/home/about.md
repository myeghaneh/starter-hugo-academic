I am a doctoral student in computational linguistics at university of Potsdam, Germany under supervision of Prof Manfred Stede.  There I work  on  converting computational corpora analysis to interpretable argumentation mining using natural language processing and deep learning.

I am also working as a research assistant in Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, There I work as research assistat on the third  party project about  inforation extraction and identifcation  of  scientific arguments using natrual langauge procssing and machine learning tools.\
I graduated from KHU Tehran with a master's in Numerical Analysis and Freie Universität Berlin with a master's in Scientific Computing with a focus on machine learning. I have also 4 years tearching exprience in Applied Mathemtics. \

**Some of my current research interest are:**

* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Argumentation Mining
* Interpretable Deep Learning for NLP
* Mathematics of Machine Learning
